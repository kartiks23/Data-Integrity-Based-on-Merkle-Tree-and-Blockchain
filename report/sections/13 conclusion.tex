\section{Conclusion}
Using blockchain instead of a third-party auditor ensures the reliability of data auditing. Verification timing of Sparse Merkle Tree is least. The audit based on the Sparse Merkle hash tree improves the efficiency of computing and storage.
The feasibility of our scheme is proved, and the comparative experiments with other schemes confirm that the scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of blockchain computational overhead.
The experimental analysis shows that our scheme achieves the expected security and efficiency goals.
