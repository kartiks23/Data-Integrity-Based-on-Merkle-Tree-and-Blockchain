\subsection{Blockchain Technology}
A blockchain is a chain of one block after another. Each block holds a certain amount of information, and they are connected in a chain in the order of the time they were created. This chain is kept in all the servers, and the whole blockchain is secure if there is one server working in the whole system. These servers are called nodes in the blockchain system, and they provide storage space and arithmetic support for the whole blockchain system. To modify the information in the blockchain, one must obtain the consent of more than half of the nodes and modify the information in all the nodes, which are usually in the hands of different subjects, making it extremely difficult to tamper with the information in the blockchain. Compared with traditional networks, blockchain has two core features: data is difficult to be tampered with and decentralized. Based on these two features, the information recorded by blockchain is more authentic and reliable, which can help solve the problem of people's mutual distrust.
