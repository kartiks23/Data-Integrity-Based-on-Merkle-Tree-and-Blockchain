With the large-scale application of cloud storage, how to ensure cloud data integrity has become an important issue. Although many methods have been proposed, they still have their limitations.
In the proposed work, first analysing time complexity for insertion and verifaction in different Merkle tree's.

Cloud storage is an essential method for data storage. Verifying the integrity of data in the 
cloud is critical for the client. Traditional cloud storage approaches rely on third-party auditors (TPAs) to 
accomplish auditing tasks. However, third-party auditors are often not trusted. To eliminate over-reliance on 
third-party auditors, this paper designs a blockchain-based auditing scheme that uses blockchain instead of 
third-party auditors to ensure the reliability of data auditing. Meanwhile, our scheme is based on the audit 
method of the quad Merkle hash tree, using the root of the quad Merkle hash tree to verify the integrity of 
data, which significantly improves computing and storage efficiency. Automated verification of auditing 
activities by deploying smart contracts on the blockchain allows us to have a more up-to-date picture of data 
integrity. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through security analysis and experiments, which prove 
that the proposed scheme is secure and effective.
