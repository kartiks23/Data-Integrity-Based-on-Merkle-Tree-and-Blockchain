Data security is crucial for ensuring the integrity and availability of outsourced data.

\textbf{Preventing Data Tampering:}  With the increasing reliance on digital data storage ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. The Merkle tree and blockchain-based scheme provides a robust solution to address this issue. 

\textbf{Trust in Data: }The scheme ensures that the data has not been tampered with and provides an immutable record of its integrity and authenticity, which enhances trust in the data.

\textbf{Improved Security: }Traditional auditing methods often rely on centralized systems, which can be vulnerable to attacks. In contrast, the Merkle tree and blockchain-based scheme provides a decentralized approach, making it more secure against attacks.

\textbf{Cost-Effective:} The scheme is also cost-effective compared to traditional auditing methods since it uses a decentralized system, reducing the need for third-party auditors and infrastructure.
