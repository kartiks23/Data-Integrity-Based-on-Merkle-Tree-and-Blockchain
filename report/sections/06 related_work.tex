  Reference & Objective & Advantage & Disadvantage\\
  \hline
  Jianbing Ni et al. \cite{1} & 
  Identity-Based Provable Data Possession From RSA Assumption for Secure Cloud Storage.
  
& 
 IB-PDP from RSA assumption provides enhanced security for cloud storage.

 & 
The IB-PDP from RSA assumption protocol is based on the RSA assumption, which assumes that the RSA problem is hard. \\ 
  \hline
  Yang Yang et al. \cite{2} & 
  An Efficient Identity-Based Provable Data Possession Protocol With Compressed Cloud Storage. 

& 
 EIB-PDP protocol approach reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on the cloud server and transmitted over the network, resulting in a more efficient protocol.
 & 

The protocol is relatively complex, and it may require significant resources to implement and maintain. \\
  \hline
  Genqing Bian et al.\cite{3} & 
   Certificateless Provable Data Possession Protocol for the Multiple Copies and Clouds Case.
& 
The CL-MC2-PDP protocol supports data redundancy across multiple cloud servers, making it suitable for cloud storage systems that use multiple cloud servers to store user data.
 & 
The protocol requires the management of public and private keys for each user and cloud server.\\ 
  \hline
  Fran√ßoise Levy-dit-Vehel et al. \cite{4} & 
A Framework for the Design of Secure and Efficient Proofs of Retrievability. 
& 
The POR protocol should provide strong security guarantees, ensuring that the data stored on the cloud server has not been tampered with or deleted.
 & 
The framework is relatively complex, and it may require significant resources to implement and maintain. \\
  \hline
  Xiao Zhang et al. \cite{5} & 
  Proofs of retrievability from linearly homomorphic structure-preserving Tag natures.
& 
The homomorphic structure of the LH-SP tags enables efficient verification of multiple tags at once, reducing the overhead of verifying the integrity of multiple files.
 & 
The LH-SP Tag-based PoR protocol may not be applicable to all cloud storage systems, as it requires the use of LH-SP tags and bilinear pairings.\\
\hline
  Binanda Sengupta et al. \cite{6} & 
  Efficient Proofs of Retrievability with Public Verifiability for Dynamic Cloud Storage.
& 
 The protocol provides public verifiability, which allows anyone to verify the integrity of the data without requiring any secret information.
 & 
The protocol does not support efficient verification of dynamic data updates, which could be a limitation for cloud storage systems with frequent updates.\\
\hline
   L. Min et al. \cite{7} & 
   Integrity verification for multiple data copies in cloud storage based on quad merkle tree.
& 
This provides strong security guarantees, ensuring that the data copies have not been tampered with or deleted.
 & 
The method is based on quad merkle, which may require expertise and resources to implement and maintain.\\
