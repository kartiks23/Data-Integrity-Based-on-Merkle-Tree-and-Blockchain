# Data-Integrity-Based-on-Merkle-Tree-and-Blockchain
Using blockchain instead of a third-party auditor to ensure reliability and prevent data tampering. 
Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of different types of Merkle Tree’s. 
To improve time complexity of Model, using SMT instead of Quad and Hybrid Merkle Tree.
